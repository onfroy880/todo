The main purpose of this application is to allow users to create, organize and track their daily tasks efficiently.

The first step of the project was to understand the users' needs in terms of task management. After conducting surveys and interviews, we identified the following features:
1- Creating tasks: Users should be able to create new tasks by specifying a title, description, due date and time.
2 - Reminders and notifications: Users should receive reminders and notifications for their upcoming tasks, so they don't forget important deadlines.
3- Marking tasks complete: Users should be able to mark tasks as complete once they have been completed, to keep track of their progress. To do this, users must go to the interface displaying the list of undone tasks and double click on it.
